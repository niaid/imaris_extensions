<h1 class="title">Register Multiple Images Using a Common Channel</h1>
</header>
<p><a href="https://github.com/niaid/imaris_extensions">View on
GitHub</a></p>
<p>This program allows you to register multiple images using
<strong>affine</strong> transformations and requires that there be a
<strong>common channel</strong> across all images. Registration is based
on maximization of correlation, hence the requirement for a common
channel. The use of an affine transformation assumes that the images
only undergo global transformations, that is, they are rotated,
translated, scaled possibly with differnt scales per axis, and sheared.
Local deformations are not accounted for.</p>
<p>The program can be run either as an Imaris extension via the Imaris
user interface or as a standalone program. It supports registration of
multi-channel z-stacks (a.k.a. 3D images, volumes) and multi-channel 2D
images (single slice z-stack). Sample datasets are freely availabe <a
href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4632320">on zenodo</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/niaid/sitk-ibex">source code for the
registration</a> is freely available on GitHub. This registration
workflow was originally developed as part of the work described in: A.
Radtke et al. "IBEX - A versatile multi-plex optical imaging approach
for deep phenotyping and spatial analysis of cells in complex tissues",
<em>Proc Natl Acad Sci</em>, 2020, <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2018488117">doi:10.1073/pnas.2018488117</a>.</p>
<h1 id="inputoutput">Input/Output</h1>
<p>The program's input are two or more files in Imaris format that share
at least one common channel. The channel to use for registration is
based on the channel names in the file. A channel name consists of three
parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>prefix</li>
<li>separator character</li>
<li>postfix</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The user can specify a separator character, which indicates that
channels with the same postfix are the same channel, otherwise the whole
channel name is used. For example, two files with channels named
<em>Experiment1 : CD3_AF594</em> and <em>Experiment2 : CD3_AF594</em>.
If we specify colon as the separator character these channels will be
considered as the same channel, otherwise they are different.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Channel names in an input file are expected to
be unique, as there can only be one registration channel per file. The
uniqueness is based on the separator character scheme described above.
For example, a file containing two channels named <em>step 1 : CD3</em>
and <em>step 2 : CD3</em> is considered valid if the separator character
is empty, but it would be invalid if we use colon or space as the
separator character, in which case both channel names become
<em>CD3</em>.</p>
<p>The program will save the following outputs:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>A single Imaris file containing the resampled volumes. All channel
information is copied over from the original volumes.</li>
<li>A log file containing internal registration information (useful for
debugging purposes understanding why a registration failed and how to
configure the program to address the issue).</li>
<li>A json file specifying the program settings used for registration
(useful for reproducing the registration).</li>
<li>Optional pdf files showing the correlation between channels before
and after registration. This is useful for quantitatively evaluating the
registration.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="program-settings">Program Settings</h1>
<p>To see the current settings or modify them, press the "Advanced
Registration Settings" button on the second screen. You can also load
settings from previous registrations via the json configuration saved
from a previous run (see above).</p>
<p>Options include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>z expand factor - Useful when the number of slices in the z-stack is
small (~5). Setting this value will expand the number of slices in the
stack via interpolation. The expansion utilizes the SimpleITK <a
href="https://simpleitk.org/doxygen/latest/html/classitk_1_1simple_1_1ExpandImageFilter.html">ExpandImageFilter</a>.</li>
<li>FFT based initialization - initialize the translation using the
SimpleITK <a
href="https://simpleitk.org/doxygen/latest/html/classitk_1_1simple_1_1MaskedFFTNormalizedCorrelationImageFilter.html">MaskedFFTNormalizedCorrelationImageFilter</a>.</li>
<li>2D affine - project the data along the z direction and perform an
initial 2D affine registration which will then be used to initialize a
3D affine registration.</li>
<li>3D affine - perform 3D affine registration.</li>
<li>Adjust spacing magnitude to be near 1 - resample the image so that
the voxel sizes are not too small, e.g. 0.001. This improves the
registration's numerical stability.</li>
<li>Auto mask - limit voxels used in registration to non zero
voxels.</li>
<li>Samples per parameter - number of samples used during
registration.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>When performing registration we usually use the full resolution
image, default selection for the "Start registration at resolution"
dropdown. When working with large images this may require a significant
amount of memory (RAM). When memory resources are constrained, one can
try to start the registration at a higher level of the image pyramid,
coarser data representation, which requires less memory. Note that the
closer one is to the apex of the image pyramid the coarser the data
representation which is potentially detrimental to registration
accuracy.</p>
<h2 id="z-stack-registration">z-stack Registration</h2>
<p>Most of the time you can run the program using the default
registration settings.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first registration step, FFT based
initialization, requires a significant amount of RAM. On lower end
machines (32GB RAM or less) it may not work. This can be ameliorated by
disabling this option and enabling the 2D affine initialization
step.</p>
<p><strong>Failure:</strong> When the FFT based initialization step
fails the whole registration may fail too. If this happens, disable the
FFT option, enable the 2D affine initialization and redo the
registration.</p>
<h2 id="d-image-registration">2D Image Registration</h2>
<p>To perform 2D registration use the default settings (2D affine
enabled, FFT initialization and 3D affine disabled). If registration
doesn't succeed you can try modifying masking and samples per parameter
or the selection of the fixed image.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Imaris images, including 2D images, are
positioned in 3D space. When performing 2D registration we check whether
the slices are on the same z-plane (using SimpleITK epsilon). In all
cases the images are registered. If they are not on the same plane, a
warning about this is provided as part of the registration completion
message. It is up to the user to decide whether this is an issue or if
this information can be ignored. The resulting 2D image is positioned in
3D space using the z-plane of the fixed image.</p>
<h2 id="d-registration">2.5D Registration</h2>
<p>In some rare cases you may want to register a z-stack using a 2.5D
approach. That is, the z-stack is projected along the z-direction using
a mean projection, affine registration is performed in 2D and then the
z-stacks are aligned in the z-direction so that their centers are
aligned.</p>
<h2 id="results-with-artifacts">Results with artifacts</h2>
<p>In some cases we have observed that registration appears to work, but
the final result contains strange artifacts even though the input images
<strong>appear to be visually valid</strong>. An example result with
artifacts is shown below (image courtesy Dr. Andrea Radtke):</p>
<figure>

alt="./images/registration_result_from_courrpt_input.jpeg" />
</figure>
<p>This is not a problem with the registration or resampling, it is a
problem with the input. The original image is already corrupt. We have
identified that this happens when the image is imported into imaris from
its original file format and the resulting imaris file is saved to a
network or external drive. <strong>Copy the original image to the local
drive, import into imaris and save to local drive, problem
solved.</strong></p>
<div class="line-block">I want to know more:<br />
  *<em>Q</em>*: Why does my original image appear to be visually valid
and yet you claim it is corrupt?<br />
  *<em>A</em>*: The imaris file format is hierarchical, an image
pyramid. When we open an image in imaris we are looking at a low
resolution version of the image, close to the apex of the pyramid. These
images are usually very small and are saved correctly over the network.
When we zoom into the image, the imaris viewer will switch to a higher
resolution version of the image from the pyramid. The closer we get to
the base the larger the image and the higher the chance that it be
corrupted when saving over the network. The registration uses the base
image (highest resolution) and resamples it, and thus exposes that the
image is corrupt.<br />
  Don't trust us? If your registration result exhibits artifacts, open
your original image in imaris and zoom in, the artifacts will
"magically" appear.</div>
